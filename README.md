3.DeFi projects focused on lending and borrowing allow users to lend and take out a loan by using software and bypassing the need to engage a trusted third party. Instead of using paper contracts, they leverage on the use of code to automate processes such as calculating interest rates and maintenance margins necessary in lending. For instance, a user wishing to lend part of their cryptocurrencies will send their desired amount to lend in form of tokens and or coins to an address controlled by the protocol. In return, they earn interest depending on the amount lent.

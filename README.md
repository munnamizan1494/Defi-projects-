About defi projects 
We can discribe defi projects as bellow>>
1.DeFi, also known in full as Decentralized Finance, is a complete ecosystem of financial applications built on other blockchain networks.
2.DeFi projects earn this term because they are supposed to be fully non-custodial and decentralized. Non-custodial means the system doesn't manage or are  control the user's crypto assets. DeFi projects allow you to be in full control of your cryptocurrency, you do not deposit your asset with a central authority.
Defi projects are solving unique problems within the financial services industry.
3.DeFi projects focused on lending and borrowing allow users to lend and take out a loan by using software and bypassing the need to engage a trusted third party. Instead of using paper contracts, they leverage on the use of code to automate processes such as calculating interest rates and maintenance margins necessary in lending. For instance, a user wishing to lend part of their cryptocurrencies will send their desired amount to lend in form of tokens and or coins to an address controlled by the protocol. In return, they earn interest depending on the amount lent.
Now lets jump into some Top DeFi Products & Lending Platforms

When it comes to the creation of next-generation financial primitives, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) does just that. By leveraging open source software and composable frameworks, DeFi allows anyone in the world to utilize financial services in a trustless and transparent manner. Simply put, DeFi aims to remove intermediaries to provide the world with a globally inclusive financial system
Lending
DeFi allows any individual to take out or supply a loan without approval from a third party. The large majority of lending products use popular cryptocurrencies such as Ether ($ETH) to secure outstanding loans through over-collateralization. Thanks to the advent of smart contracts, maintenance margins, and interest rates can be programmed directly into a borrowing agreement with liquidations happening automatically should an account balance fall below a specified collateral ratio.

The relative interest earned from supplying different cryptocurrencies varies relative to the asset and platform being used. Our lending page has an intuitive overview of the different lending rates on leading platforms.
